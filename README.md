# c++-problem-solving

This hobby project uses C++ to solve numeric puzzles as those proposed by Project Euler.

This is a personal, exploratory project with no fixed roadmap. Its aim is essentially to improve my skills. Development happens irregularly as time permits.

Project Euler : [1](https://projecteuler.net/problem=1), [2](https://projecteuler.net/problem=2), [3](https://projecteuler.net/problem=3), [4](https://projecteuler.net/problem=4), [5](https://projecteuler.net/problem=5), [6](https://projecteuler.net/problem=6), [9](https://projecteuler.net/problem=9)

Solutions are proposed in self-supporting C++ files.  
A global `main` function solves all the above problems one after the other.  
A test suite is also proposed.
