# c++-problem-solving

This hobby project uses C++ to solve numeric puzzles as those proposed by Project Euler.

This is a personal, exploratory project with no fixed roadmap. Its aim is essentially to improve my skills. Development happens irregularly as time permits.

Project Euler : 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 9
